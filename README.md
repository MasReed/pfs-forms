# Personal Financial Statement Form Generator

### A side project to generate personal financial statements with dynamic asset listing and calculations for partial ownership

#### A personal financial statement (PFS) is a document outlining an individual's financial position at a given point in time. There are generally lists of their total assets, liabilities, and a calculation of their net worth as a metric for their financial health.

#### Most PFS forms and templates statically created excel sheets meant for the web 10 years ago. This project attempts to facelift the way PFS documents are generated leveraging web application technologies.
